# resume

This repository contains Typst source code of my resume using a custom, minimal
Typst template designed specifically for software/machine learning engineers.

The output is frequently uploaded to my personal web page and can be found
[there](https://kirillbobyrev.com/resume.pdf).

## Building

To compile the resume, you need to have [Typst](https://typst.app/) installed.

```bash
typst compile resume.typ
```

This will generate `resume.pdf` in the same directory.
